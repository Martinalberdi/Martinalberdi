I am Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the European University Institute. I will be a visiting student at Princeton University in the fall semester 2024. In my dissertation project, I examine how climate policies influence political behavior, focusing on how energy policies affect homeownersâ€™ perceptions of economic well-being within different types of energy transitions. I ground my thesis in the social insurance literature, arguing that climate policies enable some groups to build ecological wealth. More broadly, I am interested in the political consequences of progressive policies implemented by left-wing parties that benefit higher income groups, and when these make or break winning electoral coalitions.
