I am an PhD Candidate in Political Science at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. I work in the fields of comparative politics and political economy, with a geographic focus on Western Europe, and a substantive focus on the intersection between climate and welfare related policies.

My research agenda centers on the intersection between (green) fiscal policies and distribution, attempting to understand the role of governments, firms and citizens in driving forward different types of renewable electrification processes. 

I attempt to understand the political causes behind different renewable energy deployment strategies and the political consequences for fastening (or not) the ecological transition via green voting and other behavioral expressions of support.
